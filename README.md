rcl
===

Similar to what autojump is to cd, recycle is to rm.
And no, this is not a command line trash can.

Pretty much what this does is, when removing a file with 'rcl'(instead of 'rm') it hashes it with sha512, and indexes it if it is an archive, folder, etc.
And...Of course, this could potentially serve as a recovery system for super computers willing to use the hash and indexed data to bruteforce the file back into existance
